Sample Camera App using CameraX api to click multiple photo by holding shutter button and store in one album with timestamp. 
HomeScreen displays all albums. While clicking photos preview is available which shows captured album.
Full screen photo can be shown in albums on click by user.
MVVM Pattern used. Room DB used.

Problem Statement:
Create a camera app that uses the CameraX library https://developer.android.com/training/camerax.

1. The camera should be an in-app camera.
2. The app should be able to click multiple photos in one go.
3. We should also be able to preview all photos.
4. Photos taken in one go should be stored together as part of one photo album.
5. Home screen should display albums of photos taken together. Clicking which should lead to photos that can be previewed.
6. Use MVVM architecture pattern to develop the app.
7. Also use Room Db to store the name of the photos clicked alongwith their timestamp and album name
8. Write 2-3 automated unit test case to test the code
9. Min sdk support 23
10. Target SDK 29
11. Please use kotlin to develop the application
